Two VM CentOS 8 (for beginning there is just one for cost's reduce)

1. Check that free space is more than 40 Gb.
The problem is that it is "impossible" (almost) increase the space on system disk. So it is possible to create lvm and guarantee that all space of lvm is used even if it is added after.
